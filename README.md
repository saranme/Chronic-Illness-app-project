# chronic_illness_app_project

This is an exploration and predicting pain level project about a chronic illness app for patients.
You can find the exploration presentation here https://slides.com/sara-6/deck/live?context=editing#/0/17

What is this about?:
- How patients with chornic illnesses behave in the app?
- Who are these patients?
- Do you want to know your pain level? Try the predictor program I created.
